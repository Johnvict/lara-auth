This project is a part of some of my private repositories. It only showcase a few of my coding styles and how I implement some app features on my own, such as
- Validation Handling and Error Messages
- Response sent for every request, using HTTP status code 200 for all requests
- While code 200 is used, distiguished response code and status are sent based on response type
